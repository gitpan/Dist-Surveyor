SYNOPSIS
        my $options = {
            opt_match => $opt_match,
            opt_perlver => $opt_perlver,
            opt_remnants => $opt_remnants,
            distro_key_mod_names => $distro_key_mod_names,
        };
        my @installed_releases = determine_installed_releases($options, \@libdirs);

DESCRIPTION
    Surveys your huge ball of Perl modules, jammed together inside a
    directory, and tells you exactly which module is installed there.

    For quick start, and a fine example of this module usage, see
    dist_surveyor.

    This module have one exported function - determine_installed_releases

determine_installed_releases($options, $search_dirs)
    $options includes:

    opt_match
        A regex qr//. If exists, will ignore modules that doesn't match this
        regex

    opt_perlver
        Skip modules that are included as core in this Perl version

    opt_remnants
        If true, output will include old distribution versions that have
        left old modules behind

    distro_key_mod_names
        A hash-ref, with a list of irregular named releases. i.e.
        'libwww-perl' => 'LWP'.

    $search_dirs is an array-ref containing the list of directories to
    survey.

OTHERS
    This module checks $::DEBUG and $::VERBOSE for obvious proposes.

    This module uses Dist::Surveyor::Inquiry to communicate with MetaCPAN.
    Check that module's documentation for options and caching.

    You can use Dist::Surveyor::MakeCpan to take the list of releases and
    create a mini-cpan containing them.
